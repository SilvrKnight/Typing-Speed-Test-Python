# Speed Typing Test

The Speed Typing Test is a Python program that allows users to test their typing speed and accuracy. Users are presented with a pre-defined text and asked to type it as accurately and quickly as possible. The program calculates the words per minute (WPM) and accuracy based on the user's input.

## Features

- Pre-defined text: Users are provided with a specific text to type.
- Timer: The program starts the timer as soon as the user begins typing.
- Words per minute (WPM) calculation: The program calculates the user's typing speed in words per minute.
- Accuracy calculation: The program evaluates the accuracy of the user's typing.
- Incorrect word display: If the user's input is not 100% accurate, the program displays the positions and incorrect characters that were typed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your_username/speed-typing-test.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd speed-typing-test
   ```

3. Run the program:

   ```shell
   python speed_typing_test.py
   ```

## Usage

1. The program presents a pre-defined text to the user.
2. Press Enter to start the timer and begin typing.
3. Type the text as accurately and quickly as possible.
4. Press Enter when finished.
5. The program calculates the words per minute (WPM) and accuracy based on the user's input.
6. The results, including WPM and accuracy, are displayed to the user.
7. If the accuracy is less than 100%, the program shows the positions and incorrect characters that were typed.
